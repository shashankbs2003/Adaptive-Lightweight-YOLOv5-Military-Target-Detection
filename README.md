# Adaptive-Lightweight-YOLOv5-Military-Target-Detection
A lightweight YOLOv5-based system for detecting and classifying military targets in low-visibility conditions like fog, smoke, and night vision scenarios.
# Adaptive Lightweight YOLOv5-Based Network for Military Target Detection  

This repository contains a deep learning-based object detection system designed to classify and detect military targets—such as weapons, personnel, and equipment—under low-visibility conditions like fog, smoke, and poor lighting. Built using a lightweight version of YOLOv5, the system is optimized for real-time performance on resource-constrained devices such as drones and edge hardware.
